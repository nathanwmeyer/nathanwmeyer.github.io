<h1>Senior Project</h1>
<p>This project was for CST-451 and CST-452. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate planning and design capabilities.</p>
<p>This project is a website where users can register and login to play a game based on Lights Out. The user can choose to start a new game, save a game in progress, and resume a saved game at any time. Both user login information and saved game data are stored securely in a relational database.</p>
