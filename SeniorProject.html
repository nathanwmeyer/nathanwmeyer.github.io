<h1 style="color:red">This portfolio is a work in progress and will be improved in the final Milestone for CST-452</h1>
<h1>Senior Project</h1>
<p>This project was for CST-451 and CST-452, part of the Bachelor of Science in Software Development at Grand Canyon University. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate planning and design capabilities.</p>

<br />
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<h5>Problem and Project Background</h5>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop an online game application that allows users to play a puzzle game where internet access is available. The goal is to provide entertainment for users by developing an application that is easy to access and use.</p>
<h5>Application of Christian Worldview</h5>
<p></p>
<h5>Project Objectives</h5>
<p>The objective of this project is to build a web application that can be accessed by users. The users will be able to log in to play the game and can save the games they are playing to their logged-in account.</p>
<h5>Project Challenges and Measures of Success</h5>
<p>The project will meet six deadlines during its development. The project\’s success is measured by what percentage of goals had been met before each deadline.</p>
<h5>Benefits and Opportunities</h5>
<p>This project will allow all participating developers to gain experience in the web application development field and demonstrate knowledge of common development practices.</p>
<h5>Project Summary</h5>
<p>This project is a website where users can register and login to play a game based on Lights Out. The user can choose to start a new game, save a game in progress, and resume a saved game at any time. Both user login information and saved game data are stored securely in a relational database.</p>

<h3>Design Diagrams</h3>
<p>Insert Design Diagrams here before</p>
<img src="img/ProjectSitemap.png" alt="image of project sitemap" />
<p>This diagram is of the application’s sitemap, showing what parts of the application can be accessed through other parts of the application. The game can only be accessed after creating a user and logging in, otherwise, the user will be redirected to the registration page.</p>
<br />
<img src="img/ProgramFlowchart.png" alt="image of project flowchart"/>
<p>This image details the program flow for the application. When the user first accesses the website, they are allowed to either login or register as a new user account. If the user attempts to access the game without either logging in first or creating an account, they will be redirected to the User Registration page. After registering or logging in, the user will be allowed to access and play the game. While they are playing the game, the user has three options. They can choose to save the game which saves the game to a MySQL database, they can choose to load one of their saved games from a list of saved games retrieved from the MySQL database, or they can choose to restart the game with a new puzzle to solve.</p>
<br />
<img src="img/HomeWireframe.png" alt="image of home page wireframe"/>
<p>This Wireframe Diagram shows an example of the application’s home page, users would see this page when first accessing the website. This page would allow them to access the Login and Registration Pages.</p>
<br />
<img src="img/RegistrationWireframe.png" alt="image of registration page wireframe"/>
<p>This Wireframe Diagram shows an example of the application’s registration page, users would see this page when first registering as a user. The user needs to provide a username and password to play the application’s game.</p>
<br />
<img src="img/LoginWireframe.png" alt="image of login page wireframe"/>
<p>This Wireframe Diagram shows an example of the application’s login page, users would see this page when signing into the application to play the game. The user must log in to play the game, as user information is required to save the game.</p>
<br />
<img src="img/GameWireframe.png" alt="image of game page wireframe"/>
<p>This Wireframe Diagram shows an example of the application’s game page, users would see this page when playing the game. This game is a version of the game “Light’s Out” where the objective is to ensure that all of the buttons are unlit. Pressing a button changes the state of the button and the surrounding buttons.</p>
<br />
<img src="img/UMLDiagram.png" alt="image of project UML diagram" />
<p>This is the UML Class Diagram for the application. This diagram details the classes used to store and represent data for the Game Buttons, Game Save Data, and User Data. The diagram also details the controller classes used to navigate and perform functions and the services used to play the game and connect with the MySQL database to manage User and Game Save data.</p>
