<h5>Project Objectives</h5>
<p>The objective of this project is to build a web application that can be accessed by users. The users will be able to log in to play the game and can save the games they are playing to their logged-in account.</p>
<h5>Project Challenges and Measures of Success</h5>
<p>The project will meet six deadlines during its development. The project’s success is measured by what percentage of goals had been met before each deadline.</p>
<h5>Benefits and Opportunities</h5>
<p>This project will allow all participating developers to gain experience in the web application development field and demonstrate knowledge of common development practices.</p>
<h5>Project Summary</h5>
<p>This project is a website where users can register and login to play a game based on Lights Out. The user can choose to start a new game, save a game in progress, and resume a saved game at any time. Both user login information and saved game data are stored securely in a relational database.</p> <br/>
